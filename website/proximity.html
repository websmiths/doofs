            <h2>Location Matters</h2>
            
            <p>The location of events has a dramatic impact on their effect on the surrounding community. Recent events have been held in locations that are far too close to residential areas with young families.</p>

            <h3>The Difference in Impact</h3>
            <p>Earlier event locations were at least beyond most of the existing dwellings. While still causing issues with noise and traffic, they had the advantage of some distance from the densest residential areas.</p>

            <p>More recent locations, however, lack this buffer. These properties are closely surrounded by homes with young families, fundamentally changing the nature of the impact.</p>

            <h3>Young Families and Background Noise</h3>
            <p>For families with young children, the disruption is particularly severe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Disrupted sleep schedules</strong>—children unable to sleep during events lasting 8-36+ hours</li>
                <li><strong>Cranky, exhausted children</strong> the following days</li>
                <li><strong>Stressed parents</strong> dealing with sleep-deprived kids</li>
                <li><strong>Safety concerns</strong> about children being exposed to large crowds and unfamiliar people camping nearby</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of outdoor space</strong> as yards become unusable due to noise</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Background Noise is Nature</h3>
            <p>In rural areas near national parks, the normal background noise consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bird calls</li>
                <li>Wind through trees</li>
                <li>Creek sounds</li>
                <li>Occasional animal noises</li>
                <li>Natural quiet</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is what residents expect and what they chose when deciding to live in this area. The background noise should not be thumping bass and crowd noise for up to 36 hours at a stretch, several times per year.</p>

            <h3>The Right Location for Events</h3>
            <p>If events must occur, they should be held:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Far from residential clusters</strong>, particularly those with young families</li>
                <li><strong>On properties with substantial buffer zones</strong> to minimise noise impact</li>
                <li><strong>In areas where natural features</strong> (hills, forests) provide acoustic barriers</li>
                <li><strong>With consideration for prevailing winds</strong> and sound travel patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Where the acoustic environment</strong> is already compromised (near highways, industrial areas) rather than in pristine natural settings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Respect for Residential Areas</h3>
            <p>Residential areas, particularly those with young families, deserve special consideration. These are not appropriate locations for events that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate industrial-level noise</li>
                <li>Last for extended periods</li>
                <li>Draw hundreds of people</li>
                <li>Involve camping on public roads</li>
                <li>Create safety and access issues</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
            <p>Location is not just about where the stage is set up—it's about the entire impact radius of the event. When choosing a venue, organisers need to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How far the sound will travel</li>
                <li>Who will be affected</li>
                <li>Whether there are particularly vulnerable populations nearby (families with young children, elderly residents, people with health conditions)</li>
                <li>Whether the location can truly accommodate the scale of the event without imposing on others</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The current trend toward events in closer proximity to residential areas is moving in exactly the wrong direction. If these events are to continue, they need to move further away from homes, not closer to them.</p>
