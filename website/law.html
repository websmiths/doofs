                    <div class="email-body">
                        <p>Dear Matt,</p>
                        <p>I am writing to follow up regarding ongoing issues with large, disruptive parties on Fox Rd in Rosebank. It has now been <strong>over a year</strong> since I provided the council with details about these events, yet no effective action has been taken.</p>
                        <p>To clarify, these are the same individuals referenced in <strong>CRM 17364/2024</strong>, from the past weekend and I request that these details and my initial email be attached to that case or any recent event numbers raised.</p>
                        <p>This past weekend, another large-scale party took place, with hundreds of vehicles speeding up and down Fox Rd. As a result, the road—recently repaired by council—has already begun to deteriorate, with potholes reappearing.</p>
                        <p>The situation has escalated to the point where residents feel powerless. When we call the police, we are told they are unable to act due to the scale of these events and that we should contact the council instead. Unfortunately, despite providing detailed information last year, the council has taken no meaningful action.</p>
                        <p>We are all at our wits' end. These parties are disrupting the entire neighbourhood, damaging infrastructure, and creating safety risks. <strong>It is only a matter of time before a serious incident occurs</strong>—whether it is a fatal accident on the road caused by reckless driving or a violent confrontation stemming from residents' growing frustration.</p>
                        <p><strong>I must ask again: what is the council going to do about this?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yours sincerely,<br>Jason Baldwin Cole</p>
