            <h2>Beyond Private Land Capacity</h2>
            
            <p>These gatherings have grown far beyond what can be reasonably contained on private property. Each event sees acres of crown land and public roads transformed into makeshift camping areas, creating serious safety and access issues.</p>

            <h3>The Road as a Campsite</h3>
            <p>During events, every available spot on Maso Road becomes occupied by parked and camping vehicles. Following the "small" 150-person event, community members reported:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Vehicles parked <strong>on the road itself</strong>, not on the shoulder</li>
                <li>Road access completely blocked—passing an oncoming car would be impossible</li>
                <li>Driveways barely accessible, with residents unsure if they'd be able to reach their own homes</li>
                <li>The entire road corridor from the event site up to residential driveways occupied by camping</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Emergency Access Compromised</h3>
            <p>On a recent occasion, a walk up into the national park revealed a concerning situation: large vehicles camped on both sides of the road made it nearly impossible to turn a small car around. <strong>An emergency vehicle would not be able to get through.</strong></p>
            
            <p>While the probability of an emergency may be low, the risk increases with each event. When hundreds of people gather in a remote area with compromised access, the potential consequences of blocked emergency services become severe.</p>

            <h3>Mess and Environmental Impact</h3>
            <p>The camping creates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Waste accumulation on public land</li>
                <li>Sanitation issues without proper facilities</li>
                <li>Environmental damage to sensitive areas near national parks</li>
                <li>Noise disturbance extending far beyond the event property</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>If organizers want to accommodate events of this scale, they need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adequate on-site parking</strong> that doesn't spill onto public roads</li>
                <li><strong>Designated camping areas</strong> entirely on private property</li>
                <li><strong>Clear access routes</strong> for emergency vehicles at all times</li>
                <li><strong>Proper sanitation facilities</strong> for the number of attendees</li>
                <li><strong>Professional event infrastructure</strong> appropriate for the scale</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Public roads and crown land should not be treated as overflow parking and camping areas for private events. The current approach is not only inconsiderate but potentially dangerous.</p>
