            <h2>The Growing Scale of Events</h2>
            
            <p>One of the primary concerns is the dramatic increase in event size over recent years. What organisers refer to as "small gatherings" are, in reality, large-scale events that rival small festivals.</p>

            <h3>Scale Reference Points</h3>
            <p>If a "small gathering" consists of 150 people that eventually swells to over 200 attendees, this provides important context for understanding what might be considered a "normal" or "large" event. According to organisers, such an event required considerable effort to organise—indicating it's far from a casual get-together.</p>

            <h3>The Reality</h3>
            <p>To community members who have lived in the area for decades, an event with 150-200+ people is undeniably a <strong>big event</strong>. When organisers claim "it was just a small party," yet acknowledge it took substantial planning and coordination, they're speaking out of both sides of their mouth.</p>

            <p>The larger events exceed even these numbers, pushing well into festival territory with reports of events capped at 400 people with ticketed entry.</p>

            <h3>Why Size Matters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure requirements:</strong> Events of this scale require proper facilities, parking, sanitation, and security</li>
                <li><strong>Safety considerations:</strong> Larger crowds mean greater risks and more complex emergency response needs</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental impact:</strong> More people means more vehicles, more camping, more waste, and more noise</li>
                <li><strong>Community disruption:</strong> The impact on neighbouring properties and public roads scales with attendance</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> Events of this size typically require permits and professional event management</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Inconsistency</h3>
            <p>Organisers cannot have it both ways—claiming events are "small" and informal while simultaneously describing them as complex operations requiring significant planning and resources. This inconsistency undermines trust and suggests an unwillingness to acknowledge the true scale and impact of these gatherings.</p>
