            <h2>The Escalation of Event Frequency</h2>
            
            <p>Over the past 3-4 years, what were once rare gatherings have become regular occurrences happening multiple times annually. This dramatic increase in frequency has transformed the nature of the impact on the community.</p>

            <h3>Full Moon Parties</h3>
            <p>These are Full Moon parties—let's call them what they are. What was once an occasional event has become a predictable pattern tied to lunar cycles, occurring several times throughout the year.</p>

            <h3>Lack of Advance Notice</h3>
            <p>The community generally receives little to no advance warning about upcoming events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most residents are <strong>not informed in advance</strong></li>
                <li>When notification does occur, organisers claim it's just a "small gathering"</li>
                <li>The actual scale of events consistently exceeds what was communicated</li>
                <li>No opportunity for residents to plan around or prepare for the disruption</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Impact of Repetition</h3>
            <p>When events happen repeatedly, the impact changes from an occasional inconvenience to a chronic problem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cumulative stress</strong> on residents who never know when the next event will occur</li>
                <li><strong>Sustained damage</strong> to roads and infrastructure from repeated high traffic</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing wildlife disruption</strong> rather than isolated incidents</li>
                <li><strong>Erosion of community trust</strong> as patterns of behavior become clear</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of home value</strong> as the area becomes known for noise issues</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>One-offs vs. Patterns</h3>
            <p>There's a significant difference between tolerating an occasional event and dealing with a recurring pattern:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One-off events can be endured with good humor and community spirit</li>
                <li>Regular events become an ongoing burden that affects quality of life</li>
                <li>The "ask for forgiveness not permission" approach only works once or twice</li>
                <li>Repeated offences demonstrate a lack of respect for neighbours</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Predictability and Planning</h3>
            <p>If events are going to occur regularly, the community deserves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advance notice</strong> of at least several weeks</li>
                <li><strong>Accurate information</strong> about expected attendance and duration</li>
                <li><strong>Clear communication</strong> with all affected residents, not just select neighbours</li>
                <li><strong>Annual calendar</strong> so residents can plan around events</li>
                <li><strong>Reasonable limits</strong> on total number of events per year</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Cumulative Effect</h3>
            <p>Each individual event might be survivable, but the cumulative effect of multiple events per year is unsustainable. Residents who have lived in the area for decades are seeing their peaceful rural lifestyle systematically eroded by an increasing frequency of large-scale events that were never part of the community character.</p>

            <p>If organisers want to host regular events, they need to find a location and develop infrastructure that can support this level of activity without repeatedly impacting the same residential community.</p>
