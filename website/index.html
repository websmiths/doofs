            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Over the past few years, outdoor electronic music parties (commonly known as "doof parties") have increased significantly in our area. While we believe these types of events should be allowed to happen, they need proper infrastructure in appropriate locations. Our road and community currently lack the necessary facilities to safely and responsibly host events of this scale.</p>
            
            <p>This website documents the various concerns raised by community members who have lived in this area for decades and witnessed the escalation of these events.</p>

                    <h3>Size</h3>
                    <p>Events have grown from "small gatherings" to festivals of 150-400+ people, far exceeding what can be safely managed on private land.</p>

                <a href="infrastructure.html" class="issue-card">
                    <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
                    <p>Public roads become sprawling campsites, blocking access and creating safety hazards. Emergency vehicle access is compromised.</p>
                </a>

                <a href="road.html" class="issue-card">
                    <h3>State of the Road</h3>
                    <p>Fox Road is not designed for this level of traffic. Reckless driving, congestion, and road damage are recurring problems.</p>

                    <p>Industrial-level bass noise (30+ dB over background) lasting 8-36+ hours, breaching NSW noise regulations.</p>

                    <h3>Frequency</h3>

                <a href="community.html" class="issue-card">
                    <h3>Community</h3>
                    <p>Lack of meaningful consultation with neighbours. The "ask for forgiveness, not permission" approach is inconsiderate.</p>
