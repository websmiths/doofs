            <h2>A Commercial Enterprise</h2>
            
            <p>What began as informal gatherings has evolved into commercial operations generating significant revenue, yet operating without the proper licensing, infrastructure, and safety measures required of professional events.</p>

            <h3>The Numbers</h3>
            <p>Based on reports from attendees and organizers, the scale of these operations is substantial:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attendance caps</strong> of up to 400 people</li>
                <li><strong>Ticket prices</strong> of $60 per person</li>
                <li><strong>Gross revenue</strong> of approximately $24,000+ per event (from ticket sales alone)</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple events per year</strong> multiplying the total revenue</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's nearly $25,000 in revenue for a single weekend event—before considering any additional income from bar sales, merchandise, or other on-site enterprise.</p>

            <h3>Small Festival Territory</h3>
            <p>Events of this scale and revenue are definitively in the territory of small festivals. They should be treated as such, with appropriate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event permits and licenses</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Insurance coverage</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Professional security</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Safety plans and emergency procedures</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation and waste management</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Traffic management</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Noise control measures</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Infrastructure Requirements</h3>
            <p>If these are genuine festival operations, they need festival infrastructure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Private property with adequate capacity</strong>—no overflow onto public land</li>
                <li><strong>On-site parking</strong> for hundreds of vehicles</li>
                <li><strong>Designated camping areas</strong> with proper facilities</li>
                <li><strong>Professional-grade toilets and waste disposal</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Clear access routes</strong> for emergency vehicles</li>
                <li><strong>Sound engineering</strong> to minimize off-site impact</li>
                <li><strong>Professional event staff and security</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lip Service vs. Real Safety</h3>
            <p>At best, lip service is being paid to these critical requirements. Even if events were completely contained on private land (which they aren't), the current approach to safety and infrastructure is inadequate for operations of this scale.</p>

            <h3>Regulatory Requirements</h3>
            <p>Events generating this level of revenue and attendance typically require:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Council approval and event permits</li>
                <li>Compliance with noise regulations</li>
                <li>Public liability insurance</li>
                <li>Licensed security personnel</li>
                <li>First aid and emergency response plans</li>
                <li>Traffic management plans</li>
                <li>Environmental impact assessments</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There's no indication that these requirements are being met.</p>

            <h3>The Informal vs. Commercial Distinction</h3>
            <p>When events were truly informal gatherings with no entry fee, the expectations were different. But once money changes hands on this scale, it becomes a business operation that needs to meet business standards.</p>

            <p>You cannot:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Charge festival prices</li>
                <li>Generate festival-level revenue</li>
                <li>Attract festival-sized crowds</li>
            </ul>
            <p>...and then claim it's just a casual gathering that doesn't need proper oversight.</p>

            <h3>Community Benefit?</h3>
            <p>When significant revenue is being generated, the question becomes: what is being put back into the community and the infrastructure that's being impacted?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are organizers contributing to road maintenance?</li>
                <li>Are they supporting local emergency services?</li>
                <li>Are they compensating neighbors for the disruption?</li>
                <li>Are they investing in proper facilities to reduce impact?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The evidence suggests the answer is largely "no."</p>

            <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
            <p>If you're running a business—and at this scale with this revenue, you are—then operate like a professional business:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get the proper permits and licenses</li>
                <li>Invest in appropriate infrastructure</li>
                <li>Hire professional security and safety staff</li>
                <li>Obtain proper insurance</li>
                <li>Engage meaningfully with the community</li>
                <li>Take responsibility for your impact</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The current approach of generating substantial revenue while avoiding the responsibilities and costs of professional event management is neither sustainable nor fair to the community bearing the impacts.</p>
