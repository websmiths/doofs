            <h2>Excessive and Persistent Noise Pollution</h2>
            
            <p>The sound systems at these events have grown progressively bigger and louder. What residents experience is not music enjoyment but industrial-grade noise pollution that persists for extended periods.</p>

            <h3>The Nature of the Noise</h3>
            <p>What residents hear is characterized by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repeated pounding in the 50-200 Hz range</strong> (low frequency bass)</li>
                <li>Duration of <strong>8 to 36+ hours</strong> depending on the event</li>
                <li>Bass levels at approximately <strong>twice the volume</strong> of the rest of the mix</li>
                <li>Sound quality akin to <strong>industrial noise</strong> rather than music</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Residents report that they can sometimes hear the doof while in bed, with the door closed and earplugs in. This is not ambient background noise—this is intrusive, unavoidable sound pollution.</p>

            <h3>Geographic Impact</h3>
            <p>The impact varies by location:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>People down the hill on Maso Road</strong> have a mountain between them and the noise source</li>
                <li><strong>Those in the valley and on the ridge</strong> receive the full brunt of the noise directly</li>
                <li>Distance provides little relief—measurements taken approximately <strong>2 km from the site</strong> still show excessive levels</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Documented Evidence</h3>
            <p>Comprehensive noise monitoring has been conducted, with evidence showing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>30+ dB over background noise</strong> in low frequencies</li>
                <li>Worst readings around <strong>63 Hz</strong></li>
                <li>Measurements taken approximately <strong>2 km from the event site</strong></li>
                <li>Multiple events documented with consistent patterns</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Video Evidence</h3>

            </div>

            <h3>Legal Standards</h3>
            <p>In NSW, a noise is generally considered a nuisance if it's <strong>more than 5 dB over background noise</strong>. The documented levels of 30+ dB over background clearly breach this standard by a factor of six or more.</p>

            <p>There are specific laws regarding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What constitutes offensive noise</li>
                <li>When you can and cannot make noise</li>
                <li>Permissible noise limits</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Pretty much all of these regulations are being breached at some level during these events.</p>

            <h3>Impact on Residents</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Inability to sleep without earplugs during events</li>
                <li>Noise intrusion even with earplugs and closed doors</li>
                <li>Disruption to daily activities for the entire duration</li>
                <li>Stress and health impacts from prolonged exposure</li>
                <li>Loss of peaceful enjoyment of property</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>One-offs vs. Frequency</h3>
            <p>While a single instance of loud music might be tolerable as an occasional community event, the increasing frequency of these parties transforms them from one-off nuisances into an ongoing pattern of noise pollution that significantly impacts quality of life.</p>
