            <h2>A Road Under Stress</h2>
            
            <p>The thought of Fox Road's condition during and after these events causes genuine distress for long-term residents. This rural road was simply not designed to handle the volume and type of traffic these events generate.</p>

            <h3>Reckless Driving</h3>
            <p>During events, the road sees a dramatic increase in dangerous driving behavior:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Excessive speed</strong> on roads not designed for it</li>
                <li><strong>Convoys driving in formation</strong> down the middle of the road</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicles taking tight corners recklessly</strong> in groups</li>
                <li>Drivers unfamiliar with the road conditions and hazards</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Community members report encountering "several convoys of traffic driving what I would consider recklessly (too fast, middle of the road in tight convoy)" on their way out during event days.</p>

            <h3>Traffic Congestion</h3>
            <p>The sheer volume of vehicles creates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Severe congestion on normally quiet rural roads</li>
                <li>Extended travel times for residents trying to access their homes</li>
                <li>Dangerous bottlenecks at narrow sections</li>
                <li>Conflicts between event traffic and local residents</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Road Damage</h3>
            <p>The excessive vehicle movement during events takes a toll on the road infrastructure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accelerated wear and deterioration of the road surface</li>
                <li>Damage from vehicles that are too large or heavy for the road</li>
                <li>Rutting and erosion from vehicles parking on shoulders</li>
                <li>Long-term degradation that affects all residents year-round</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact on Daily Life</h3>
            <p>For residents who use Fox Road daily, the impact is significant:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Safety concerns about sharing the road with reckless drivers</li>
                <li>Inability to freely access their own properties</li>
                <li>Damage to personal vehicles from deteriorating road conditions</li>
                <li>Increased stress and reduced quality of life</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
            <p>Rural roads like Fox Road serve specific purposes for local communities. They are not meant to be event access roads for hundreds of vehicles. The combination of reckless traffic, congestion, and road damage creates an unsustainable situation that degrades both the infrastructure and the safety of the area.</p>

            <p>If events of this scale are to continue, they need to be located on properties with adequate access via roads designed for high traffic volumes, not on rural lanes serving residential communities.</p>
