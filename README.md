# Sound Monitoring

A small experimental project exploring urban/environmental sound monitoring. The repository contains:
- A simple static website with short explainers (in the `website/` folder)
- Sample screen recordings and clips (in the `src/` folder)
- Example rendered outputs (in the `output/` folder)
- Notes/arguments (in the `arguments/` folder)

## Quick start
- Open `website/index.html` in your web browser to view the static pages.
- Browse `output/` to see example rendered videos.

No build step or runtime is required.

## Repository structure
- `website/` — static HTML/CSS pages discussing noise monitoring topics such as frequency, proximity, road noise, wildlife, community, infrastructure, business, and size.
- `src/` — source screen recordings used for demonstrations (MP4 files).
- `output/` — example exported/combined videos.
- `arguments/` — notes and drafts.

## How to use
- View the site: open `website/index.html` directly in a browser.
- Reuse media: the MP4 files in `src/` can be used in your video editor or analysis tooling.
- Share examples: the `output/` folder contains ready-to-share example videos.
