# Doof parties

Having lived here for 20 years and being on the ridge where we hear noise from any direction, I feel like I can offer a perspective.

Bottom line, over the past few years, these ‘parties’ have increased in size, volume, frequency and now proximity. I think these types of events should be allowed to happen but they need to have the right infrastructure in the right location and our road and community do not have that. 

While I appreciate the perspective of ‘come on, let’s just have some fun’, as an argument it lacks a lot of context. 

I haven’t seen any indication that there’s a genuine effort to address any of these issues.

## Size
If a ‘small gathering’ is 150 people, that blows out to over 200, this is a reference point for what might be considered a ‘normal’ or ‘large’ event. Apparently it was a small event that took considerable effort to organise. You can’t really have it both ways. To me that’s a big event and the others are bigger. 

## Infrastructure
These gatherings are way beyond the scope of what can be contained on private land. Each time, acres of crown/public land (i.e. the road) become a sprawling campsite. Coming home past the ‘small’ party on Sunday, I found that every available spot on Maso Road up to my driveway was parked out. Not on the side of the road, ON the road. Passing a car coming the other direction would be impossible. Fortunately my driveway was (just) clear, but approaching it I had my doubts.

The camping blocks escape routes. It creates mess and noise. If you want to accommodate this scale of event it should be completely off public land.

At one recent event I happened to go for a walk up in the national park and found that it was almost impossible to turn a small car around due to large vehicles camped on either side of the road. An emergency vehicle would not be able to get through. The risk may be low, but it increases with each event.

## The State of the Road
Just thinking about the state of Fox Road gets me twitching. It is not designed for this level of traffic. On my way out on Sunday afternoon I encountered several convoys of traffic driving what I would consider recklessly (too fast, middle of the road in tight convoy). Reckless traffic, congestion and road impact from excessive vehicle movement are not good things.

## Noise
The sound systems seem to be getting bigger and louder. I’ll refrain from giving my opinions on what constitutes good sound (but it doesn’t involve subs at twice the volume of the rest of the mix). What I hear at our place is akin to industrial noise. Repeated pounding in the 50–200 kHz range I’d say, for between 8 and 36+ hours depending on the event. I always put in earplugs if I’m trying to sleep during one of these events, which mitigates the problem somewhat (for me), but it doesn’t help for the rest of the time. (Sometimes I can year the doof in bed, with the door closed and earplugs in.)

People down the hill on Maso Road have a mountain between them and the noise. Those of us in the valley and on the ridge cop it directly. It’s different.

Briefly, there are laws around what constitutes offensive noise, when you can and can’t make noise and what the limits are. Pretty much all of these are being breached at some level. One-offs are one thing, but this brings me to frequency.In NSW a noise is generally considered a nuisance if it’s more than 5dB over background noise. I have collected plenty of evidence showing 30+ dB over background in the low frequencies (around 63Hz is worst). This is from readings taken approximately 2 km from the site.

## Frequency
In the past 3-4 years, these Full Moon parties (let’s call them what they are) have started happening several times a year. We generally aren’t informed in advance, if we are we’re told there’s a small gathering happening. 

## Community
Informing a couple of neighbours (presumably those who are cool with it or perhaps immediate neighbours who are guaranteed to be affected) doesn’t constitute any sort of consultation or meaningful dialogue. We don’t feel like we’re part of the ‘tribe’ and while we may be welcome to gate crash it’s not really our scene. Heck, I wasn’t even offered a toke the other night, despite the obvious Atmos.

The ‘we provide you guys with a free PA’ argument is pretty weak. Happy that you’ve got a fantastic PA that you want to use as often as possible, but really if that’s what you’re putting back into the community it’s pretty much the least you could do.

The approach of ‘don’t ask for permission, ask for forgiveness’ is inconsiderate at best.

## Wildlife

Excessive noise in national parks — from vehicles, aircraft, or recreation — disrupts the delicate acoustic environments many forest species depend on. The worst outcomes include:

- **Communication breakdowns**  
  Loud background noise masks calls used for mating, navigation, and alarms, leading to failed pairings, lost offspring, and territory abandonment. Over time this can cause local population collapse.

- **Chronic stress and habitat displacement**  
  Persistent noise elevates stress hormones, weakens immune function, and reduces fertility. Animals often avoid noisy zones, effectively fragmenting habitat and pushing them into lower-quality areas.

- **Local extinctions from acoustic avoidance**  
  When adaptation fails, species may abandon habitats altogether. Populations can vanish despite suitable vegetation or food sources.

### Affected Species in Northern NSW Forests
- **Greater Glider (*Petauroides volans*)** – Sensitive to disturbance; noise and fragmentation compound decline in old-growth eucalypt forests.  
  *[The Guardian, 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/20/australia-greater-gliders-endangered-species-list-protection)*  
- **Booroolong Frog (*Litoria booroolongensis*)** – Relies on clear acoustic signalling; noise can disrupt mating calls in stream habitats.  
  *[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booroolong_frog)*  
- **Forest Bats** – Echolocating species experience reduced foraging success and altered flight paths under high ambient noise.  
  *[Australian Academy of Science](https://www.science.org.au/curious/earth-environment/noise-pollution-and-environment)*

Overall, unmanaged noise pollution threatens not only individual species but also the ecological integrity and visitor experience of Australia’s national parks.

## Proximity
The properties up the hill are at least beyond most of the existing dwellings. Gary’s house is not, it is closely surrounded by young families. Background noise is nature.

## The Party Business
It’s clear that some of these events are money making ventures. I heard (from the punters) that one was capped at 400 with $60 tickets. Seems reasonable perhaps. That’s getting on for $25K in revenue for a weekend. And that’s just ticket sales. I’d be surprised if other enterprise wasn’t happening on the side. 

This is definitely in the territory of small festival (at least). Events of this nature should have proper (private) infrastructure,  safety plans, proper security etc. At best, lip service is being paid to these issues but even if this was contained on private land, it should be better.
